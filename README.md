# FlightPathAnalysis
This repository contains code to: 1) download ADS-B (flight path) data and airport list, 2) preprocess the ADS-B data to smooth out anomalies, 3) estimate different phases of flight, 4) visualize, animate and analyze flight paths of aircraft, 5) model flight path with the goal to (semi-)automate the role of a traffic controller
